# Dwarf

Most dwarves hail from the mountains and hills of [Bern](../nations/Bern.md).
King Desmond is their ruler, and he traces his line back to [Hartmut](../gods/Hartmut.md) the Hero.
Legend says that Hartmut himself dealt the final blow that slew the Demon Dragon.
Armies across all of Elibe fear Bernâ€™s vicious corps of Wyvern Riders.
