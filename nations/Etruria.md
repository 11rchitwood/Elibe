# Etruria

Etruria is a theocratic country in western Elibe.
It shares a maritime border with the Western Isles, which it has begun colonizing.
It also borders Ilia, Sacae, Lycia, and the Nabata Desert.
Etruria was founded by [Elimine](../gods/Elimine.md) after the Scouring.
Their beurocratic governemnt consists of priests, bishops, and archbishops with a figurehead king.
Since the St. Elimine Church rules, piety and self-righteousness make power there.

Etruria is one of the two most powerful countries in Elibe.
Its dry summer climate is mitigated by powerful magic allowing crop production.
Etruria doesn't have a strong martial force, but they make heavy use of Ilian mercenaries when needed.
