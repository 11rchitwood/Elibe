# Sacae

Sacae is the easternmost nation of Elibe.
It is situated south of Ilia and North of Bern.
Sacae is by and large a sweeping expanse of grassland bordered to the north and south by mountains.
These mountains house bands of bandits who are in constant conflict with the nomadic tribes who inhabit the plains.
Its status as a "nation" is loosely defined as it possesses no central government.
It is home to only one major city, Bulgar.
[Hanon](../gods/Hanon.md) the Ranger founded Sacae after the events of the Scouring.
