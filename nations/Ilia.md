# Ilia

Ilia is territory occupying the northeastern forests and peaks of Elibe.
Because the country has little arable land, many of its people turn to mercenary work to survive.
Ilian mercenaries are known for their strict code of absolute loyalty to their employers.
They derive this sense of honor from Ilia's founder [Barigan](../gods/Barigan.md) the Faithful.
The mercneary leader with the highest reputation is the defacto ruler of Ilia.
Pegasi are native to Ilia, and so Pegasus Knight units make up much of their ranks.
