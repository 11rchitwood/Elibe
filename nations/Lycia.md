# Lycia

The Lycian League, commonly known as Lycia, is located in the center of Elibe.
It shares borders with nearly every other nation.
Lycia was founded by [Roland](../gods/Roland.md) the Thief, one of the Eight Legends.
Lycia is a federation composed of several small territories known as marches.
The marches of Lycia are: Araphen, Caelin, Cornwell, Khathelet, Laus, Ostia, Pherae, Ragna, Ryerde, Santaruz, Tania, Thria, Tuscana, Worde, and Zem.
Each march is ruled by a house with a leader called a marquess.
House Ostia is Roland's birthplace and Lycia's most powerful house.
Marquess Ostia is the defacto leader of Lycia.
