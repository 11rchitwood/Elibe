# Western Isles

The Western Isles are an archipelago of mineral-rich islands on the north-western coast of Elibe.
Three major islands comprise the nation: the central-north Island Fibernia, the southwestern island Caldonia, and the northeastern island Dia.
For much of their history, the Isles have been ruled by Etruria as colonies.
The Etrurian mining industry has been exploiting the people there, even using the Islanders as slaves.

The Western Isles were founded by [Durban](../gods/Durban.md) the Berserker in the aftermath of the Scouring.
He formed a clan of warriors there whose descendants are now tribal leaders under Etruria's thumb.
Some Islanders have begun to organize in an attempt to overthrow their oppressers.
