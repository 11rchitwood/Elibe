# The Search for Arcadia

Arcadia the Village of Dragons is a place some regard as a mere myth. Supposedly, itâ€™s existence stretches back a millennium back the days of The Scouring. Arcadia was founded by dragons and humans that did not wish to partake in the Scouring. To avoid the war, a hidden village deep in the desert was created and hidden by sandstorms. It successfully remained a secret to the majority of the outside world for a millennia after the scouring.

An enigmatic man seeks to find the location of Arcadia for mysterious reasons. You have been hired as an exploration crew to comb the Nabata Desert and find the fabled city. The journey will test the very limits of your survival skills, and it is unknown who or what you might encounter on your expedition.
