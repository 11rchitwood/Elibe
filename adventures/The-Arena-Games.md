# The Arena Games

A mysterious benefactor has re-opened the famous Arena Games in Badon. The Games havenâ€™t been held in many years, but the city is teeming with excitement to see which gladiator will come out on top. It remains unclear why exactly the games are being held again, but you have signed up to test your mettle in combat, perhaps at the cost of your life. But if you win, you will attain true glory, and maybe more.
