# Dark Tides in Badon

Darkness grows in Lyciaâ€™s busiest port city. Merchant ships are going missing. An upstart paladin is gaining notoriety for his not-so-noble deeds in the local arena. Rumors spread of monstrous beings growing more bold at the marshy margins on the city.

Lord Eliwood, heir of House Pherae, is seeking passage to Valor, the Dread Isle, in search of his father, who has been missing for some months. Captain Fargus is the only sailor willing to ferry him there, and you are the only adventurers brave (or foolhardy) enough to escort the wayward lordlIng there.
