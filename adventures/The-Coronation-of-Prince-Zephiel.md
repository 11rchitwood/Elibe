# The Coronation of Prince Zephiel

It’s no secret that King Desmond of Bern detests his firstborn son and natural heir Prince Zephiel. His loveless marriage with Hellene of Etruria has all but ended. She and Zephiel live comfortably exiled in a well-attended manse outside of Castle Bern’s grounds. Still Prince Zephiel visits the royal courts often, and the Bernese people have come to revere Zephiel as their nation’s future.

Rumor has it that King Desmond has hired outsiders to steal the Fire Emblem, thereby denying Zephiel the ability to be named heir at his coming-of-age ceremony. You have been hired by an anonymous actor to attend Zephiel’s coming-of-age ceremony and prevent this from occurring at all costs. Any violent outcomes threaten to upend Zephiel succession to the throne, so you have been provided a full cover story to attend the ball and foil Desmond’s evil plot.
