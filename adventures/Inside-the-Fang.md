# Inside the Fang

The Black Fang, a renowned guild of mercenaries, appears to have abandoned their code of honor. They accept recruits with no scruples or skill. They kill with reckless abandon. There are even rumors of strange, ethereal-looking new leaders among their ranks.

House Ostia, premier among the Lycian League, doesnâ€™t like the looks of these developments. Lord Uther has hired you to go undercover and infiltrate the Black Fang. He cannot risk any direct associations with House Ostia as such a discovery could upset the delicate balance of power within Lycia. This covert mission could make or break a peace that has taken centuries to create.
