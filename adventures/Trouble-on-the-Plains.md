# Trouble on the Plains

Lord Hausen, Marquess of House Caelin, has fallen ill. At his deathbed, he wishes to reconnect with his long lost daughter Madelyn, who eloped with a Sacaean nomad some years ago. You and your compatriots have been hired to search the plains to find her and convince her to ride back to Caelin to see her father.

More and more, bandits have been venturing down from the mountains and raiding lesser tribes and unsuspecting travelers. You will need to be ready for anything on this mission as itâ€™s unknown how deep into the plains you may go.
