# Halflings

Halflings are small folk who love home and hearth.
They call the many marches of [Lycia](../nations/Lycia.md) home.
Despite their small size and domestic nature, some halflings have an adventurous spirit.
[Roland](..gods/Roland.md) the Thief joined the Legendary Heroes in their quests to defeat the Demon Dragon.
