# Elves

Elves are known as sons and daughters of light.
Many worship St. Elimine and were born in [Etruria](../nations/Etruria.md).
Elves are long-lived and so many have dedicated their lives to the Faith.
They worship [St. Elimine](../gods/Elimine.md) and seek to radiate her light.
They say the Demon Dragon could not withstand Elimine's light.
Elves think of themselves as firstborn of all Elibean peoples.
Their aptitude for magic serves as evidence for this belief.
In fact, some elves think that they are the closest living relatives of dragonborn.
