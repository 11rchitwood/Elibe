# Humans

Humans are native to the vast open plains of [Sacae](../nations/Sacae.md).
Most are nomadic folk of horse and bow.
Their tribes follow roaming herds of aurochs and depend on those beasts for almost every aspect of their lives.
[Hanon](../gods/Hanon.md), the divine trooper, is the spiritual mother of Sacaean tribes.
