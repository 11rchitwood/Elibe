# Elibe

Once, dragons and men coexisted.
They shared a peace forged in wisdom, a peace that lasted many generations.
All that was lost when mankind disrupted this balance in a sudden onslaught.
Man fought dragon in a savage war that shook the foundations of their world.
This war was called The Scouring. Defeated and humbled, dragons vanished from the realm.
In time man rebuilt, and spread his dominion across the land and on to the islands beyond.
A millennium has passed since those dark days ended.

It is an Age of Peace.

Humanity has flourished since the apocalyptic events of The Scouring.
Eight heroes rose up and vanquished the Demon Dragon with the help of their divine weapons.
Utterly defeated, the dragons withdrew from the land, making way for the Human Era.

But an Age of Peace isn’t always what it seems.
Rumors spread of enmity within Bern’s royal family.
The common folk lament corruption and abuse of the St. Elimine Church.
Even the smallest ruling houses in the Lycian League scrabble for the table scraps of power.
Lord Elbert of House Pherae has gone missing.
The invisible ties that hold society together stretch to near breakage.

## Elibean Folk

[Dwarves](species/Dwarf.md), Elves, Goliath, Halflings, [Humans](species/Human.md), and Orcs are common folk in Elibe.
Each species has its own native land and culture.
More exotic folk, such as Aasimar, Dragonborn, and Tieflings are rare in Elibe.
Most folk such as these choose to hide their true nature from others.

You might be an elf, son or daughter of light. You probably worship St. Elimine and were born in Etruria, a theocracy where self-righteousness and piety make power.

You might be a halfling, living in one of the many marches of Lycia. The Lycian League is a pluralistic society comprising folk of all backgrounds. You trace your lineage to Roland, the little thief, least of the Eight Legendary Heroes.

You could be an Orc, native to the Western Isles. Many folk label your people as violent savages, but you know that yours is a rich culture spanning back to the original Berserker himself, Durban, strongest of the Eight Legendary Heroes.

You could be a Goliath born in the frozen wastes of Ilia. Barigan is your hero, and since your homeland has little arable land, many follow in his footsteps as mercenaries and warriors. Your homeland is also the native land of Pegasi, and as a result is the only nation with Pegasus Knights as part of its armed forces.

Although a rare sight, you could hail from other far-off lands and look quite different from the folk described previously. Aasimar, Dragonborn, and Tieflings can all be found in Elibe, but they must hide their true nature from others.

## Dark Tides in Badon

*Rescue the father.*

High Combat | Medium Exploration | Low Roleplaying

Darkness grows in Lycia’s busiest port city. Merchant ships are going missing. An upstart paladin is gaining notoriety for his not-so-noble deeds in the local arena. Rumors spread of monstrous beings growing more bold at the marshy margins on the city.

Lord Eliwood, heir of House Pherae, is seeking passage to Valor, the Dread Isle, in search of his father, who has been missing for some months. Captain Fargus is the only sailor willing to ferry him there, and you are the only adventurers brave (or foolhardy) enough to escort the wayward lordlIng there.

## The Arena Games

*Win the games.*

High Combat | Low Exploration | Medium Roleplaying

A mysterious benefactor has re-opened the famous Arena Games in Badon. The Games haven’t been held in many years, but the city is teeming with excitement to see which gladiator will come out on top. It remains unclear why exactly the games are being held again, but you have signed up to test your mettle in combat, perhaps at the cost of your life. But if you win, you will attain true glory, and maybe more.

## Trouble on the Plains

*Find the girl.*

Medium Combat | High Exploration | Low Roleplaying

Lord Hausen, Marquess of House Caelin, has fallen ill. At his deathbed, he wishes to reconnect with his long lost daughter Madelyn, who eloped with a Sacaean nomad some years ago. You and your compatriots have been hired to search the plains to find her and convince her to ride back to Caelin to see her father.

More and more, bandits have been venturing down from the mountains and raiding lesser tribes and unsuspecting travelers. You will need to be ready for anything on this mission as it’s unknown how deep into the plains you may go.

## Inside the Fang

*Infiltrate the guild.*

Medium Combat | Low Exploration | High Roleplaying

The Black Fang, a renowned guild of mercenaries, appears to have abandoned their code of honor. They accept recruits with no scruples or skill. They kill with reckless abandon. There are even rumors of strange, ethereal-looking new leaders among their ranks.

House Ostia, premier among the Lycian League, doesn’t like the looks of these developments. Lord Uther has hired you to go undercover and infiltrate the Black Fang. He cannot risk any direct associations with House Ostia as such a discovery could upset the delicate balance of power within Lycia. This covert mission could make or break a peace that has taken centuries to create.

## The Search for the Fabled City of Arcadia

*Locate the city.*

Low Combat | High Exploration | Medium Roleplaying

Arcadia the Village of Dragons is a place some regard as a mere myth. Supposedly, it’s existence stretches back a millennium back the days of The Scouring. Arcadia was founded by dragons and humans that did not wish to partake in the Scouring. To avoid the war, a hidden village deep in the desert was created and hidden by sandstorms. It successfully remained a secret to the majority of the outside world for a millennia after the scouring.

An enigmatic man seeks to find the location of Arcadia for mysterious reasons. You have been hired as an exploration crew to comb the Nabata Desert and find the fabled city. The journey will test the very limits of your survival skills, and it is unknown who or what you might encounter on your expedition.

## The Coronation of Prince Zephiel

*Stop the plot.*

Low Combat | Medium Exploration | High Roleplaying

It’s no secret that King Desmond of Bern detests his firstborn son and natural heir Prince Zephiel. His loveless marriage with Hellene of Etruria has all but ended. She and Zephiel live comfortably exiled in a well-attended manse outside of Castle Bern’s grounds. Still Prince Zephiel visits the royal courts often, and the Bernese people have come to revere Zephiel as their nation’s future.

Rumor has it that King Desmond has hired outsiders to steal the Fire Emblem, thereby denying Zephiel the ability to be named heir at his coming-of-age ceremony. You have been hired by an anonymous actor to attend Zephiel’s coming-of-age ceremony and prevent this from occurring at all costs. Any violent outcomes threaten to upend Zephiel succession to the throne, so you have been provided a full cover story to attend the ball and foil Desmond’s evil plot.
