# Elibe

Once, dragons and men coexisted.
They shared a peace forged in wisdom, a peace that lasted many generations.
All that was lost when mankind disrupted this balance in a sudden onslaught.
Man fought dragon in a savage war that shook the foundations of their world.
This war was called The Scouring.
Defeated and humbled, dragons vanished from the realm.
In time man rebuilt, and spread his dominion across the land and on to the islands beyond.
A millennium has passed since those dark days ended.

It is an Age of Peace.

Humanity has flourished since the apocalyptic events of The Scouring.
Eight heroes rose up and vanquished the Demon Dragon with the help of their divine weapons.
Utterly defeated, the dragons withdrew from the land, making way for the Human Era.

But an Age of Peace isn’t always what it seems.
Rumors spread of enmity within Bern’s royal family.
The common folk lament corruption and abuse of the St. Elimine Church.
Even the smallest ruling houses in the Lycian League scrabble for the table scraps of power.
Lord Elbert of House Pherae has gone missing.
The invisible ties that hold society together stretch to near breakage.
