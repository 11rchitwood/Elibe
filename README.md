# Elibe

Elibe is a fantasy RPG campaign setting.
It is adapted from the world of the sixth and seventh Fire Emblem games.

## Prologue

Once, dragons and men coexisted.
They shared a peace forged in wisdom, a peace that lasted many generations.
All that was lost when mankind disrupted this balance in a sudden onslaught.
Man fought dragon in a savage war that shook the foundations of their world.
This war was called The Scouring.
Defeated and humbled, dragons vanished from the realm.
In time man rebuilt, and spread his dominion across the land and on to the islands beyond.
A millennium has passed since those dark days ended.
